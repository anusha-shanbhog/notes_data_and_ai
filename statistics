Statistics

A/B Testing:
A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of something (Version A and Version B) to see which performs better.
Users are randomly split into two groups
Group A sees version A (control)
Group B sees version B (variation)
Performance is measured using a metric (e.g., clicks, conversions)
Purpose: to make data-driven decisions and improve outcomes.
Example:
Testing two webpage headlines to see which gets more sign-ups.


Mean, median, mode:
Mean - avg 
- used in descriptive analysis to get to know average behaviour of a dataset
- in predictive modelling many ml algos assume that data is normally distributed around mean
- data cleaning - mean is used to handle missing values in some techniques

Median - middle value of a dataset when data points are ordered from smallest to largest(in case of odd number of points), in case of even no of pts it is avg of middle 2 values
- median is less sensitive to outliers - it is used when dataset has outliers that can skew mean
- skewed distributions - not symmetrically distributed - more accurate measure of central tendency than mean
- robustness - for data that's not normally distributed, the median is often a more reliable measure of the centwr of the data

Mode - most frequently appeared value in a dataset
- one mode(unimodal), more than one mode(bimodal/multimodal), no mode(if all valuesa re unique)
- categorical data - to identify most common category or value(most frequent customer complaint)
- data cleaning - idtifying most common missing value in categorical data or choosing replacement value for missing entries
- market research - in consumer surveys, mode can be used to identify most common prefereences or behaviours


Normal distributions: type of probability distribution that describes how data values are spread around central value
- bell shaped curve
- symm abt mean

Central tendency: measures that describe the center or typical value of a dataset (mean, median, mode)


Causal inference:
Process of finding out whether changing one thing directly causes a change in another thing

Correlation: Things happen together
Causal inference: One thing makes the other happen

causal inference expalined with some examples for microsoft data scientist interview

Here’s a clear, interview-ready explanation of causal inference, tailored for a Microsoft Data Scientist interview—concise, structured, and with practical examples.

What is Causal Inference?
Causal inference is the process of determining whether a change in one variable causes a change in another, not just whether they are correlated.

Correlation answers: “What is associated?”
Causal inference answers: “What would happen if we intervened?”

Why Causal Inference Matters at Microsoft:
Microsoft products (Ads, Azure, Teams, Office, Bing) rely on decisions like:
Does a new feature cause higher engagement?
Does changing pricing cause more revenue?
Does showing an ad cause more conversions?
Incorrect causal conclusions can lead to costly product decisions.
Key Concept: Counterfactual
Causal inference asks:
What would have happened to the same user if they had NOT received the treatment?
Since we can’t observe both outcomes, we use experiments or statistical methods.

Example: A/B Testing (Randomized Experiment)
Scenario: Microsoft Teams tests a new notification design.
Treatment group: New design
Control group: Old design
Metric: Daily active users
Because users are randomly assigned, differences in outcomes can be causally attributed to the design.
